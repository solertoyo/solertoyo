		I am doing theoretical population genetics and my work is essentailly focussed on the inference of demographic parameters from genetic data. Most of my work concerns allelic data such a microsatellites or SNPs.<br><br>

		I am especially interested in realistic demographic models such as isolation by distance models. In this context, I tested the precision and robustness of a Fst-based method for the inference of density and dispersal parameters in continuous populations under isolation by distance (<a href="http://www.genetics.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/4/1219">Rousset 1997's</a> regression method). I tested the influence of demographic, mutational and sampling factor and showed that the regression method is precise and robust allowing precise inferences of present and local demographic parameters (see <a href="ressources/publis/Lebloisetal2003MBE.pdf">Leblois et al. 2003</a>,  <a href="ressources/publis/lebloisetal2004genetics.pdf">Leblois et al. 2004</a>).  I also tested the influence of local isolation by distance structure on the detection of past reduction in population sizes and habitat contraction (<a href="ressources/publis/LebloisEtAl2006MolEcol.pdf">Leblois et al. 2006</a>). For all those simulation tests and others, I developped a special simulation programme based on a generation-by-generation coalescent algorithm. The program is very flexible so that many different models of isolation by distance could be considered, with various heterogeneities in space and time of the demographic parameters. It is implemented in the software package <a href="#softwares">IBDSim</a> (<a href="ressources/publis/LebloisEtAl.2008MolEcolRess_IBDSim.pdf">Leblois et al. 2008</a>).<br><br>
        
        Recently, we developped a maximum likelihood method for the inference of demographic parameters based on Importance Sampling (IS) algorithms developped by R. Griffiths and collaborators. This work is published in <a href="ressources/publis/DeIorioEtAl2005TPB.pdf">DeIrio et al. 2006</a>, <a href="ressources/publis/RoussetLeblois2007MBE.pdf">Rousset & Leblois 2007</a>, <a href="ressources/publis/RoussetLeblois2011MBE.pdf">Rousset & Leblois 2011</a>  and the inference method is implemented in the software package <a href="#software">Migraine</a>. <a href="#software">Migraine</a> is designed to make inferences about populations sizes, migration rates and/or dispersal parameters under various models : a one- or two-dimensional Isolation by distance model, two populations with migrations, a single panmictic population and will soon be extended to other demographic models.<br><br>

		 Importance Sampling algorithms showed good performances and fast computations compared to alternative approaches. However, up to day, we only considered allelic type data (e.g. Microsatellites/SNPS/Allozymes) and few demographic models. I am currently working on the inference of past changes in population size (Leblois, Pudlo, Vitalis & Rousset in Prep), and large part of my futur work will be developing/adapting new algorithms and implementing new demographic and mutational models in the software package <a href="#software">Migraine</a>. To this aim, <a href="http://champost.wordpress.com/">Champak Reddy Beeravolu</a> is currently working with me as a Postdoc on a ANR/INRA contract.<br><br>

		Beside isolation by distance models, I am also interested in using/adapting population genetic tools to the study of recently diverging species. This lead me to work on DNA Barcoding (<a href="ressources/publis/FrezalLeblois2008IGE_Barcode.pdf">Frezal & Leblois 2008</a>, <a href="ressources/publis/AusterlitzEtAl2009BioInfo.pdf">Austerlitz et al. 2009</a>, <a href="ressources/publis/DAvidetal2011JCB_BarcodingWithCoalescent.pdf">David et al. 2011</a>) and I am currently developping maximum likelihood inferences under Isolation with Migration models (IM models, Beeravolu, Rousset & Leblois In Prep). All those implementations will soon be published and availlable in <a href="#software">Migraine</a>.<br><br>

        <h2>Postdoc and PhD opportunities :  </h2>
          I have currently no open postdoc or PhD position but several national and international funding bodies (Marie Curie, Human Frontiers, EMBO, AXA, INRA) 
          provide fellowships for young researchers who wish to conduct a postdoc in France.
          Funding for PhD positions can be obtained with the INRA.
          So, if you are interested in applying for a PhD or a postdoc position and if your research interests are broadly similar to mine, do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:leblois@supagro.inra.fr">contact me</a> (raphael.leblois@supagro.inra.fr)
